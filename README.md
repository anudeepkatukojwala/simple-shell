## Introduction

The Simple Shell project is an assignment to write a C program that acts as a simple shell on top of the Linux shell.

The program reads user input, parses it, and invokes the Linux shell to execute the corresponding command.

## Features

- Accepts Linux commands from the user
- Executes commands using the Linux shell
- Provides a user-friendly interface for command execution

#### Note: cd command is not implemented

## Requirements

To run this program, you need the following:

- A Linux-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian)
